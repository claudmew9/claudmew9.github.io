            <h3>Still Life Photography</h3>
            <p>
                The photographs explore the themes of life and death. The natural
                cycle that I portrayed though the juxtaposition of two opposing
                concepts; decomposition and vibrancy. The dark and dramatic
                lighting, which I achieved though the use of light room as well as
                photoshop, allows me to mimic Dutch still life paintings.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rotten fruit and flowers create texture and manipulate our
                perspective to make the natural objects seem alive in a simple,
                yet confronting way.

            <h2>Technicolor</h2>
            <h3>Virtual Exhibition</h3>
            <p>
                Technicolour is a compilation of all the works from aspiring design
                students. The central theme of our exhibition is colour and how we
                use colour to express social and gender views. These are confronting
                and ignored aspects of society. Gender includes the different
                perspectives on textile waste, human connection towards space, the
                loneliness in association with technology, the social status of
                people, the fear of gender and the mixed connotations towards gender.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, these works have different perspectives to remind the
                audience about social and gender views in the world.
